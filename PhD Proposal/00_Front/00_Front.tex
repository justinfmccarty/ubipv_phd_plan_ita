\section*{Abstract}

This doctoral research focuses on meeting urban energy demand through active solar renewable energy technologies that are integrated into buildings and infrastructure. Localised demand profiles for two representative urban areas will be modeled for the present and near-term future. These demand profiles will then be used to assess the capability of commercially viable and experimental/novel solar renewable technologies as greenhouse gas mitigation and abatement solutions as well as modes of adaptation to a range of future climates. 

The initial portion of the research involves a systematic literature review that characterizes the research topic within the existing environment of academic work. Simultaneous to the literature review a database will be assembled to capture the state of constructed and experimental projects. This database will be used to expand existing urban building energy modelling tools and models of solar renewable energy technologies.

The two case studies will be used as the experimental basis for testing this expanded database of models to identify where novel technologies are necessary to address energy demand. Prototypes of the novel technologies will then be built to further test their performance in digital and analog simulations. 

The results of the research process will be disseminated to several audiences including academic publication and conference pipelines, partners within the AEC industry, and civic officials related to the two case studies.
